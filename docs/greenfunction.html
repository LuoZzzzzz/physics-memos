    <h1>Green's Function and Scattering</h1>

    <p>
      Suppose we have a homogeneous linear differential equation:
      $$\mathcal{L}[y, \dot{y}, \dots] = 0$$
      Its Green's function $G(x-x')$ is then the solution to the differential equation: 
      $$\mathcal{L}[G(x, x')] = \delta(x-x')$$
      Why is this useful? Suppose we want to solve the differential equation:
      $$\mathcal{L}[y, \dot{y}, \dots] = f(x)$$
      We can take the definition of $G$ and drop integrals with respect to f(x') on both sides to get:
      $$\int f(x') \mathcal{L}[G(x, x')] \,\text{d}x' = \int f(x') \delta(x-x') \,\text{d}x'$$
      However, since $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear operator that acts on $x$ and not $x'$, we can bring the integral on the right hand side into the operator $\mathcal{L}$. 
      The right hand side is simply $f(x)$. This gives:
      $$\mathcal{L}[\int f(x') G(x, x') \,\text{d}x'] = f(x)$$
      That tells us the solution to the above differential equation is:
      $$y(x) = \mathcal{L}[\int f(x') G(x, x') \,\text{d}x']$$
      Therefore, the solution of an inhomogeneous linear differential equation is the convolution of the driving term $f(x)$ with the Green's function. 
      In other words, the Green's function can be thought of as the response of our system due to a perturbation at $x'$.

      How does it show up in the context of scattering? Consider the free space Schrodinger equation:
      $$(H_0 - E) \psi(\vec{\bf{r}}) = 0$$
      If we add in a scattering potential, then the equation becomes:
      $$(H_0 - E) \psi(\vec{\bf{r}}) = V(\vec{\bf{r}})\psi(\vec{\bf{r}})$$
      We can treat the right hand side of the equation as a "driving" term or a perturbation to our original free space equation. 
      Note that in this case, the right-hand side perturbation depends on our solution $\psi(\vec{\bf{r}})$, 
      so the situation is slightly different from above, and we will end up with an integral equation for $\psi(\vec{\bf{r}})$ instead of a direct solution. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Like before, we define the Green's function solution by:
      $$(H_0 - E) G(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}') = \delta(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}')$$
      The solution is given by:
      $$\psi(\vec{\bf{r}}) = \psi_0(\vec{\bf{r}}) + \int G(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}') V(\vec{\bf{r}}')\psi(\vec{\bf{r}'}) \,\text{d}^3\vec{\bf{r}}'$$
      where $\psi_0(\vec{\bf{r}})$ is the free space solution. We can then solve for $\psi(\vec{\bf{r}})$ using an iterative approach. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason we want to do this instead of solving the Schrodinger equation directly is because this method produces physical solutions.
      The reason is that solutions to $(H_0 - E) G(\vec{\bf{r}}, \vec{\bf{r}}') = \delta(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}')$ are not unique. 
      There are two reasons. First, if we do not restrict $G$ to be a function of $\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}'$, 
      then the general solution will be a combination of incoming/outgoing waves and plane waves corresponding to space solutions. 
      Even if we enforce this restriction, $G(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}')$ will still have degenerate solutions corresponding to incoming/outgoing waves. 
      If we attempted to solve the Schrodinger equation directly, our solver may converge towards a solution that is a mixture of all of these waves, 
      which is bad since we are dealing with a scattering problem a single well defined incoming state and a superposition of outgoing spherical waves. 
      In addition, the presence of plane wave components in the final solution will mess up our boundary condition.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our integral equation below this physical constraint is enforced because we only pick the $G(\vec{\bf{r}}-\vec{\bf{r}}')$ corresponding to outgoing waves, so our final solution will always be a single incoming wave plus a bunch of outgoing waves - therefore it remains physical. In addition, it has a nice analytical solution called the Born series.
