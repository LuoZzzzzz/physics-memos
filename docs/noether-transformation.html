    <h1>Transformations in Noether's Theorem</h1>

    <p>
      In Noether's theorem, we consider a transformation of coordinates described by:
      $$t' = t + \epsilon \tau(q_k(t), t)$$
      $$q_i'(t') = q_i(t) + \epsilon \eta_i(q_k(t), t)$$
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a nice geometrical way to think about this. Let us consider the configuration space with coordinate axes $q_1, \dots, q_N, t$. 
      The evolution of our system may be described by a trajectory (line) in configuration space. 
      Consider the vector field in configuration space given by:
      $$\vec{X} = (\eta_1(q_k(t), t), \dots, \eta_N(q_k(t), t), \tau(q_k(t), t))$$
      Now, imagine that we displace each point on our original trajectory by a small amount $\epsilon \vec{X}$. 
      This produces a new trajectory in configuration space that is described by $q_1'(t'), \dots, q_N'(t')$. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in our original equations, $q_i'(t')$ is defined in terms of $t$, but its argument is $t'$. 
      The reason is that after displacement, the point $(q_1', \dots, q_N')$ is now associated with the time $t'$, 
      since that is where the $t$ associated with the original $(q_1, \dots, q_N)$ was displaced to.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the B2 notes, the quantity $\bar{\eta}_i$ was defined to be the change in $q_i$ due to $\vec{X}$ <b>holding time constant</b>. 
      Here's how everything looks geometrically:
