    <h1>Transformations in Noether's Theorem</h1>

    <p>
      In Noether's theorem, we consider a transformation of coordinates described by:
      $$t' = t + \epsilon \tau(q_k(t), t)$$
      $$q_i'(t') = q_i(t) + \epsilon \eta_i(q_k(t), t)$$
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a nice geometrical way to think about this. Let us consider the configuration space with coordinate axes $q_1, \dots, q_N, t$. 
      The evolution of our system may be described by a trajectory (line) in configuration space. 
      Consider the vector field in configuration space given by:
      $$\vec{X} = (\eta_1(q_k, t), \dots, \eta_N(q_k, t), \tau(q_k, t))$$
      Now, imagine that we displace each point on our original trajectory by a small amount $\epsilon \vec{X}$. 
      This produces a new trajectory in configuration space that is described by $q_1'(t'), \dots, q_N'(t')$. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in our original equations, $q_i'(t')$ is defined in terms of $t$, but its argument is $t'$. 
      The reason is that after displacement, the point $(q_1', \dots, q_N')$ is now associated with the time $t'$, 
      since that is where the $t$ associated with the original $(q_1, \dots, q_N)$ was displaced to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's how everything looks geometrically:

    <p>
      In the B2 notes, the quantity $\bar{\eta}_i$ was defined to be the change in $q_i$ due to $\vec{X}$ <b>holding time constant</b>. 
      This is the red segment in the diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, imagine that we let our trajectory "flow" for a bit under the vector field $\vec{X}$. 
      This turns it from the black trajectory to the gray trajectory above. 
      We say that the transformation is a symmetry if the the action along the gray trajectory is the same as the action along the black trajectory. 
      Note that unlike in the derivation for the Euler-Lagrange equations, the endpoints of our trajectory can, and will change under the flow. 
      Note, also, that we are making the above statement for all trajectories of least action. 
      That is, we can pick any two arbitrary points, find the trajectory of least action between them, let that trajectory flow a bit under $\vec{X}$, 
      and if $\vec{X}$ is indeed a symmetry then the action along new trajectory after the flow will remain unchanged. In other words, one can think of "flow" along $\vec{X}$ as a way of generating least action trajectories between new endpoints. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noether's theorem tells us that for every such "flow" $\vec{X}$, there exists a conserved quantity. Is this intuitively obvious? I don't think so.
