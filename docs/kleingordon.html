    <h1>Klein Gordon Equation and Scattering</h1>

    <p>
      The Klein-Gordon equation (for free space) is:
      $$(\nabla^2 - \mu^2)F(\vec{\bf{r}}) = 0$$
      $F(\vec{\bf{r}})$ stands for some field (which in this case is just zero everywhere, I think). 
      If we have a scatterer (a point like nucleus for example) at the origin, 
      the interaction of the scatterer with the field will be described by the following equation:
      $$(\nabla^2 - \mu^2)G(\vec{\bf{r}}) = \delta(\vec{\bf{r}})$$
      The solution is the Green function of the Klein Gordon equation, and it is:
      $$G(\vec{\bf{r}}) = \frac{e^{-\mu r}}{r}$$
      In the above equations we have assumed that our scatterer has an interaction strength of $1$ with the Klein Gordon field. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, the correct way to think about this entire business is: we have a scatterer somewhere, it interacts with the Klein Gordon field, this in turn produces a potential that all other particles "see". 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, from perturbation theory, we worked out that the coupling between the initial and final momentum states of our scattered particle (not scatterer) is:
      $$\bra{\vec{\bf{k}}'}V\ket{\vec{\bf{k}}} = \int e^{i (\vec{\bf{k}}' - \vec{\bf{k}}) \cdot \vec{\bf{r}}} \, V(\vec{\bf{r}}) \,\text{d}^3\vec{\bf{r}}$$
      But this is just the Fourier transform of $V(\vec{\bf{r}})$, 
      and $V(\vec{\bf{r}})$ is the Green's function of the Klein Gordon equation! This leads to the statement: 
      the coupling term between the final and initial states of the scattered particle is the Green's function of the Klein Gordon equation in momentum space (with argument $\vec{\bf{k}}' - \vec{\bf{k}}$). 
      I don't know about you, but I found this rather cryptic when I first saw it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's another way of thinking about it. 
      Suppose we worked out that $\bra{\vec{\bf{k}}'}V\ket{\vec{\bf{k}}} \propto \frac{1}{|\vec{\bf{k}}' - \vec{\bf{k}}|^2 + \mu^2}$.  
      Then we should realise that since this is the Green's function of the Klein Gordon equation in $\vec{\bf{k}}' - \vec{\bf{k}}$ space. 
      Since we just performed a Fourier transform of the potential $V(\vec{\bf{r}})$ to get this, $V(\vec{\bf{r}})$ should be the Green's function of the Klein Gordon equation in position space, 
      hence the potential arises as a result of the interaction of the scatterer with the Klein Gordon field, whatever that is. 
      I think this is the logic in the notes. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I could be entirely wrong about this whole thing - better get a second opinion!
