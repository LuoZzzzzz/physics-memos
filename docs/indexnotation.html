    <h1>Index Notation</h1>

    <p>
      There are many things wrong with the following text. Plan is to highlight and fix the misconceptions slowly and write them below.
    </p>

    <p>
      $A^\mu$: column 4-vector. Capital letters stand for vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      $a^\mu$: components of $A^\mu$. Lowercase letters stand for components.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The scalar product of two 4-vectors is defined using a metric $g$:
      $$A^\mu \cdot B^\mu = g_{\mu \nu} a^\mu b^\nu$$
      $g$ is a 4 by 4 matrix. We can check that this is really just a bilinear form:
      $$\vec{A}^T g \vec{B} = a_i (gB)_i = a_i g_{ij} b_j$$
      $i$ is to $\mu$ is to row as $j$ is to $\nu$ is to column. In the world of matrices, two $j$s is a right multiplication to get a column vector and two $i$s is a left multiplication to get a row vector, assuming the conventional $ij$.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we move the $\mu$ down we get the row 4-vector $A_\mu$. Its components are defined by:
      $$a_\mu = g_{\mu \nu} a^\mu$$
      In vector form this is:
      $$A_\mu = (gA^\mu)^T$$
      The first definition does not tell you anything about the shape of $A_\mu$. It seems you need both lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      $a_\mu$ is to $A_\mu$ what $a^\mu$ is to $A^\mu$. Note that the position of the index  in the component also changes depending on the type of 4-vector. **In the world of components**, think of subscript as _left to right_ and superscript as _top to bottom_. In fact, if you think about it, $\mu$ in $a^\mu$ and $A^\mu$ do different things! In $a^\mu$ $\mu$ serves as an index - zero, one, two, three. In $A^\mu$ $\mu$ serves as an indicator that "I am a 4-vector".
    </p>

    <p>
      Raising the indices of $g_{\mu \nu}$ gives $g^{\mu \nu}$. This is, by the definition, the $\mu$ row $\nu$ column element of $g^{-1}$. Therefore:
      $$g^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \nu} = \delta ^\mu _\nu$$
      The LHS is just matrix multiplication in summation notation. The RHS is a 4 by 4 identity matrix. When deciphering the RHS recall that superscript means top down and subscript means left right. So $\delta ^\mu _\nu = I_{\mu \nu}$. We get to do this with $I$ because it is its own inverse. We cannot do the same with $g$. If we did then we run into trouble trying to get a symbol for components of $g^{-1}$. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have a row 4-vector we can turn it back into a column 4-vector by raising its indices:
      $$a^\mu = g^{\mu \nu} a_\nu$$
      This looks weird because $a_\nu$ is a component of a row 4-vector; it seems we are putting a matrix before a row vector and the shapes don't match. Things are actually fine because there are no matrices here - everybody is a number. The matrix equation is:
      $$A^\mu = g^{-1} A_\mu^T$$
      Again, the first equation does not tell us anything about the shape of the 4-vectors.
